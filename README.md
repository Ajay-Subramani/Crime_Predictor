# Crime_Predictor

Crime Rate Analysis Tool
  This project is a Crime Data Analysis Tool that allows users to analyze crime data, predict crime rates for specific populations, and generate graphs and charts based on uploaded csv data file or entered crime data. The tool is built using C++ for the backend and utilizes the FLTK (Fast Light Toolkit) framework for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). Python scripts are integrated into the project to generate graphical outputs (such as pie charts) for crime rate predictions and crime time analysis.

Features:

  Add Crime Data: Manually enter crime data such as year, area, crime type, population, crime rate, and time.
  Display Crime Data: View all entered crime data in a formatted table.
  Predict Crime Rate: Predict the crime rate for a specific population based on historical data using linear regression.
  Crime Time Analysis: Analyze crime occurrences based on the time of day (e.g., morning, afternoon, night).
  Upload CSV Data: Upload a CSV file containing crime data for automated data entry and analysis.
  Generate Crime Rate Graphs: Generate and visualize crime rate trends using Python-based pie charts and graphs.

Requirements:

  C++ Compiler: A working C++ compiler (e.g., GCC).
  FLTK (Fast Light Toolkit): Required for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
  Python 3.x: Needed to run the Python scripts for generating graphs.
  Python Libraries: matplotlib and numpy for graph generation and data analysis.

Functionalities:

  Data Entry: Users can input crime data manually through the applicationâ€™s interface.
  CSV Upload: The tool allows users to upload a CSV file containing crime data for batch processing.
  Data Visualization: Generate pie charts and graphs based on crime data, including predictions for future crime rates.
  Crime Prediction: Predict future crime rates based on population data and historical crime rates using linear regression.
  Time-based Crime Analysis: Analyze crime occurrences over different times of the day and categorize them (e.g., morning, noon, night).
  User-Friendly Interface: All interactions happen through an easy-to-use GUI built with FLTK, where users can select options and view results.

Intended Use:

  This tool is designed for crime analysts, researchers, or anyone interested in understanding trends and patterns in crime data.
  It helps in analyzing historical crime data, predicting future crime trends, and generating visual insights from the data.
  Useful for law enforcement agencies, local government authorities, and researchers in criminology or public safety studies.
